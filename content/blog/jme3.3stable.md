jMonkeyEngine 3.3.0-stable has been released!
https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/releases/tag/v3.3.0-stable


In the early morning hours of March 31, 2020, Engine Leader Paul Speed let version 3.3.0 stable come to life.
This stable release is a historic event in the advancement of the engine. It inclues a treasure chest of bug fixes, 
and a gold mine full of new features. These include some major ones like Java 11 support,
a new animation system called Monkanim, and OpenGL ES 3 support for Android. 
There are countless other features and bugfixes included which we know you'll love! 
For devs still using jME 3.2.4 or older, we highly recommend that you upgrade to this new version;
for new devs just starting with jMonkey, this new release is the perfect place to begin. 
To get started, check the link at the top.
But in this article, I cannot but end with a many thanks to the development team who spent many hard, long hours
often accompanied by headaches to advance the engine, and also the many contributors who helped along the way.

You owe it to yourself to work with jMonkeyEngine 3.3.0-stable for your next big game!
